# SHARK-CLASSIFIER
Hello everyone, I am very excited to share with you this amazing ML project called 'SHARK CLASSIFIER' it is basically an image classification project which is trained using the SVM algorithm, additionally, I used the Haar Cascade algorithm for face and eye detection and I also performed wavelet transform on the training images.

The model detects the characters even if there are more than one person in the picture.

This project was a task/exercise in the deep learning course by Mr Dhaval Patel 

The task was to make the image classification model for any of your characters, I choose the cast of a famous American reality show "Shark tank" the characters of the show are called Sharks that's why the name of this project is "SHARK CLASSIFIER".

#### During model building we have covered almost all data science concepts such as:
1. Import Libraries
2. Load Data
3. Data Preparation
4. Model Building.
5. Model Evaluation
6. Interpreting the ML Model
7. Making Predictions with the Model
8. Saving the Model (as .pkl file)
9. Deployment of the application.

### Technology and tools this project covers:
1. Python as a programming language.
2. HTML, CSS & Flask for building Web pages.
3. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning.
4. Matplotlib & seaborn for data visualization.
5. Sklearn for model building
6. pickle 
7. Flask 
8. AWS (PaaS)
9. Jupyter notebook, Spyder as IDE.
* All the steps required to execute the project have been mentioned in the .ipynb file.
* ### WEB APP
